# The Knight's Camino

Problem: How can a knight jump on an N x N chessboard in such a way that it visits every square exactly once?

Tasks
- find one tour that satisfies this condition for a given starting position.
- find all tours that satisfy this condition for a given starting position.

Bonus tasks:
- find all "closed tours" where a knight can jump to it's initial position from the final position.
- it will take the computer a long time to find all solutions, can you utilize a lazy list to
  calculate tours only as they are needed?
- make the program use all available cores
- unit tests
- functional/end-to-end tests
